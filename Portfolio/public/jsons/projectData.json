            "information": "Cormoran is the title of one of the video games I helped produce in my first year of university. In GAM190, the name given to this module, we as a team were tasked with creating a video game with the constraint: Local history. Cormoran is a game based on the legend of Jack the Giant Slayer, a Cornish legend turned global. The premise for this game is that the player (Jack) needs to find a way to kill Cormoran, seeking revenge for his father. The player navigates around St Micheals Mount, locating objects and eventually digging a hole for Cormoran to fall into, all while avoiding him. For this project, I was the developer behind the AI for the giant. This included navMesh pathfinding, raycasting, waypoint management, and player tracking. This was a very enjoyable game to work on and I would love to continue with it at some point later on.",

I was tasked with integrating an Arduino system into Unity, and creating an educational piece of software that works alongside a custom built controller. For this project, I based my idea off of the company Zipline and their delivery drones. My Controller was a gyroscopic input that reacted to 2 axes of rotation. Up and down rotation affects the falling speed of the delivery, while left and right affects the position of the delivery. As the user progresses through the story, text popups appear, explaining the process and benefits. The user was challenged with placing the delivery on a cross outside the recipients door.",
